                <p>
                    At Dewinter India, I developed automated systems for various medical tests using advanced image processing techniques. The project focused on creating comprehensive diagnostic tools for RBC classification, male vitality tests, and cell movement analysis. This system significantly enhanced the diagnostic facilities by providing accurate, efficient, and consistent analysis of medical imaging data.
