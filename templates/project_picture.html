                <p>
                    The "What's In The Picture" project involved developing an automated system for analyzing car service photos. The system was designed to perform three key functions: verify image authenticity to detect manipulated images, analyze vehicle door status (open/closed), and extract information from license plates. This solution aimed to enhance the efficiency and reliability of automotive service documentation.

                <h2 class="project-section-title">Results and Impact</h2>
                <p>
                    The project delivered an overall accuracy of 88% across its various detection and recognition components. By automating the analysis of service photos, the system significantly reduced the time required for manual verification while enhancing the reliability of vehicle documentation. This technology helps automotive service providers streamline their operations, reduce fraud, and improve customer trust through accurate record-keeping.
